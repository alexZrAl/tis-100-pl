# TIS-100-Lite

Yet another in-flight (physical) pet project. The project parses pseudo-assembly code in the game `TIS-100` and executes the code with provided input.

## Technical stack

Parsing: SWI-Prolog v8.0.3
Runtime: c++? Java? SALSA???  <!-- just realized this is a multithreaded runtime so salsa may actually be useful?? !>

## Roadmap

- Version 1.0: Full parsing.
- Version 1.2: Interpreter w/ Input/Output/Node configuration as txt file
- Version 2.0: Input/Output as GUI/TUI
- Version 2.?: vs-code plugin?
